When even a single letter in the file changes, the HMAC output becomes completely different.
This happens because HMAC uses both the message and a secret key to create a unique code.
It ensures data integrity by detecting any tampering and authenticity by confirming the message came from someone who knows the secret key.
So, HMAC protects against unauthorized changes and forgery.
