Diffie–Hellman is important for secure communication because it enables two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel without transmitting the key itself. This shared key can then be used to encrypt messages, ensuring confidentiality and protecting the data from eavesdroppers. It also provides forward secrecy, meaning that even if long-term keys are later compromised, past communications remain secure. Overall, DH is a fundamental building block for secure protocols like TLS, VPNs, and encrypted messaging, helping prevent interception, tampering, and unauthorized access.
